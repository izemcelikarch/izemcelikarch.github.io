Project Name: ROUTES TO ROOT
Project Statement: Routes to Root is proposed for the sequence of growing, knowing and learning spaces to establish and elevate social interaction between the locals and new arrivals. The proposal is designed for Kent Refugee Action Network (KRAN) in the heart of Canterbury.  KRAN is an independent charity that provides help and support to asylum seekers and refugees, including minors who have arrived in the United Kingdom unaccompanied by an adult. The project consists of individual blocks stretched along the 14th-century historic wall accommodating lecture halls, classrooms and workshops to offer diverse activities for people of all ages and backgrounds.  The overall arrangements of the project is a reflection of the lengthy and difficult journey, "the routes", that refugees have to go through to reach their new destination where they can "root" afterwards.
