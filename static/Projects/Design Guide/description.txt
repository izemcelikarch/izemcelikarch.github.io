Proposal for London-based circus school – NCCA, showing the sequence of learning to practicing and finally performing. The reversible sequence (depending on whether you are an external student or a local) is highlighted by Bauhaus influenced design language and planning arrangement inspired by Mies van der Rohe, Bernard Tschumi’s systematic abstraction and Aldo van Eyck’s playground orientated interactive forms.
The practise zone acts as a central core and meeting point for both learners and performers and emphasises drama through an orbital plan, with all spaces revolving around a central practise space.
The site also incorporates the disused shelter which is reached by a ritualistic procession from the performance space, housing food stalls and markets with ingredients brought directly from the farmer’s market held at The Oval Gardens (approximately a 3 minute walk from the shelter).
