Project Name: Form and Structure
Project Statement: In this module I had an opportunity to enhance my technical competence by investigating the relationship between structure and architecture.  The Renault Distribution Centre located at Swindon, UK was studied as a case study to identify different types of structural behaviour and some of the key properties of the most commonly used structural materials.
