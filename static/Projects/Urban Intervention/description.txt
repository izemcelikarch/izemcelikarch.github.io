Project Name:  Urban Intervention 
Project Description: The project brief compromised to develop a multi-use scheme with learning and housing facilities for three different sites located at the fringe of Canterbury. The project aims to revitalise an economically deprived and socially undeveloped area of the town through multi-disciplined proposals consisting of residential housing, museum and student accommodation. The design of three sites which act as key connectors to the city's landmarks has been developed both for the locals, students and tourists. A particular site was studied in depth; located in the proximity of a site containing the ruins of St. Augustine's Abbey Monastery. The design provided the site with a museum to exhibit some of the artefacts the site, and a residential block to sustain the growing number of populations. The site would act as an extension to the existing network of recreational interventions in Canterbury.
